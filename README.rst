History
-------

**xskillscore** was orginally developed to parallelize forecast metrics of the multi-model-multi-ensemble
forecasts associated with the `SubX <https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-18-0270.1>`_ project.

We are indebted to the **xarray** community for their
`advice <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/xarray/xskillscore%7Csort:date/xarray/z8ue0G-BLc8/Cau-dY_ACAAJ>`_
in getting this package started.
