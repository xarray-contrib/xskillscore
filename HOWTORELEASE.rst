Release Procedure
-----------------

#. Clone xskillscore from xarray-contrib, not a personal fork.

#. Create a new branch ``release-v0.0.xx`` with the version for the release.

 * Update ``CHANGELOG.rst``
 * Make sure all new changes, features are reflected in the documentation.

#. Open a new pull request for this branch targeting `main`

#. After all tests pass and the PR has been approved, merge the PR into ``main``

#. Tag a release and push to github::

    $ git tag -a v0.0.xx -m "Version 0.0.xx"
    $ git push origin main --tags

#. Build and publish release on PyPI using the GitHub action.
   Otherwise you can manually do it with the following:

    $ git clean -xfd  # remove any files not checked into git
    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal  # build package
    $ twine upload dist/*  # register and push to pypi

#. Update the stable branch (used by ReadTheDocs)::

    $ git checkout stable
    $ git rebase main
    $ git push -f origin stable
    $ git checkout main

#. Go to https://readthedocs.org and add the new version to "Active Versions"
   under the version tab. Force-build "stable" if it isn't already building.
